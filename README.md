## 👣 Getting started

This project is divided into two parts:
1. Frontend (branch master) 
2. Backend (assets directory)
3. DataBase (MySQLScript directory)

💡 It is important to remember that <b>if the database script is not executed, the application will not work!</b>.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, you will need to have the following tools installed on your machine to run the project:
[WAMP](https://www.wampserver.com) or [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/pt_br/index.html). 
If you want to see the code more deeply, I recommend the editor [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).<br>
<b>OBS</b>: During the development of the project I used [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/), however both WAMP and XAMPP have PHPMyAdmin so its installation is optional.

#### 🎲 Creating the Database (MySQL Server)

```bash

# Clone this repo
$ git clone https://github.com/GabrielGust/dear.io.git

# Access the project folder on terminal/cmd
$ cd dear-io

# Start your WAMP / XAMPP

# Go to the folder MySQLScript and execute all the script in PHPMyAdmin or MySQL Workbench

# After running all the script commands your database will be done

```

#### 🖥️ Configuring the application for localhost (WAMPP/XAMPP)

```bash

# Clone this repo
$ git clone https://github.com/GabrielGust/dear.io.git

# If you are using WAMP copy the repository and paste in: 
$ C:\wamp64\www

# If you are using XAMPP copy the repository and paste in: 
$ C:\xampp\htdoc

# The frontend is now in the localhost folder ready to run

```

#### 🖥️ Running the application (frontend)

```bash

# To run the application it is necessary to do the previous two steps

# With the previous two steps done, you will only need to type in the browser:
$ localhost/dear-io

```
